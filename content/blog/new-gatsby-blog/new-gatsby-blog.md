I have decided to recreate my mostly unused website using Gatsby and React. This is pretty much all brand new and i hope to be able to share some of my successes and failures as I go. Hopefully i can keep it going.

I used the following Tutorial on the gatsbyjs website to get setup with a landing page and a /blog/ address along with the netlify CMS admin panel.

Below is just a screenshot of where I started since its going to be a WIP.
